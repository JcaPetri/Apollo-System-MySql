Contains the relation between the BaseElements and the Kafka Topics, to make updated all the microservices.
With this table the software manages what elements will be in each microservice.
In the SysBaseElemnets_Tbl is created the KaftaTopic Scope and inside this scope you create the topics.
In this table is assigned the BaseElement to a specific Topic. 
  ***You can assign one element to more than one Topic.***
After you create or update and element, the system get the data of this table to know wich queues must be updated.
If BaseElement is a Scope, all elements it contains must be updated.

The key for each record:
  ID --> is the uniqueidentifier auto generated.
  IDNum --> is the autoincrement number auto generated.
The unique Key is the union of:
  BaseElementIDn -> the BaseElementIDn is the element, this could be an element or scope. Linked with SysBaseElements_Tbl.
  KafkaTopicIDn -> the KafkaTopicIDn is the IDNum of queue Topic. Linked with SysBaseElements_Tbl.
    Unique = One KafkaTopicIDn must be unique for each BaseElement.
Common Field/Columns for all tables
  The objective of these are to store critical information for the system and the record history.
    StatedIDn --> The StatedIDn is the IDNum that define if the record is enable or not.
    CreatedByIDn --> The CreatedByIDn is the IDNum of the user who created the record.
